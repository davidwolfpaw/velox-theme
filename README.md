# Velox - A Mobile-First, WordPress Block Ready Theme
![Velox Theme icon](screenshots/screenshot.jpg)

## Howdy

Hello there! I'm a WordPress theme based on the _s starter theme and turned into a theme for bloggers. I'm responsive and mobile first, and I was born to be friendly to the WordPress Block/Gutenberg Editor! 

I was named for [Vulpes velox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_fox), better known as the Swift Fox. That's because I do my best to be fast for your site!

I also use [semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#Semantics_in_HTML) and [microformats](http://microformats.org/) to make your site parse well for other services. More [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) features are getting added over time!

## Features

I have several features ready to go to make your site unique to you. Just by using the WordPress Customizer you have access to the following:

### Colors
*  __Background Color__
*  __Text Color__
*  __Accent Text Color__ _(things like captions, citations, post meta, and entry footers)_
*  __Accent Color__ _(things like thematic breaks, block separators, buttons, and navigation and quote borders)_
* __Link Color__ _(also progress bar color)_
* __Link Active/Hover/Focus Color__
### Theme Settings
* __Font Pairing__ - I have four default font pairings so your content always looks good!
* __Dark Mode__ - Let visitors toggle dark mode to make the page darken for low-light reading. You can default to light mode, dark mode, or remove the toggle altogehter.
* __Read Time__ - Display an estimate for how long an article will take to read.
* __Article Progress Bar__ - Show a progress bar for how far you've scrolled in an article.
* __Author Info__ - Choose whether to display the author picture, display name, and description at the bottom of articles.
